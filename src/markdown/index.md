## Hey!

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a full-stack developer that now builds toys for fun. I'm also studying for a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, experimenting with the intersection of AI and blockchain.


## I build toys ðŸª€
Currently, I'm building several toy projects at a time depending on my mood. Most of my current projects are somewhat related to blockchain and I really like to build apps for the decentralized future. Most of my current and previous projects are listed in the Projects page. With that, all my projects are open source, you can find them on Github.


## Previous Work
In the previous years, I worked as a full-stack developer mostly focused on SaaS startups. I love building stuff that people use and I enjoy seeing them use the exact tools that we have developed over the years. It's a great joy to see that I was able to add value to people's lives.

My recent job was at Wavve, worked on a tool for audio-first creators to create and distribute their contents easily. We built several features that helped thousands of creators to achieve their dreams. I'm most proud of an AI based automated highlights generator that outputs a highlights video (30sec - 3 mins) with a given podcast episode. It's live on Zapier as a Zap action and triger. The best part is that the whole infrastructure works in a serverless setup with low costs.
